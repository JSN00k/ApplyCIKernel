### What is this repository for? ###

This repository builds a command line tool for applying a CIKernel to an image. It is useful for testing any CIKernels you've written without having to have a larger project around them, or applying a CIKernel without having to write any other code.

### How do I get set up? ###

Download the repository build the Xcode project, then go into the built products and find the command line tool. either move it to somewhere in your path, or use it from where you are. For more information on the tool see my [website](http://www.twistedape.me.uk/blog/2013/08/15/tool-to-apply-cikernel/).
